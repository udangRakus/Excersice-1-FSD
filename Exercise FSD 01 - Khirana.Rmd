#percentiles 37 of Education :
```{r}
quantile(x = dataCredit$Education, probs = 0.91)
```
#percentiles 91 of Education

#correlation and plot of newData3

#PROBABILITY
#Binomial random variable :
example, if we have some coin and than we flip 10 times and the X is the number of head after flip.if the probability of coin is head P(H) = 0.6, what if we get X = 3 head on coins after 10 flip?
```{r}
dbinom(3,size = 10, prob = 0.6)
```
